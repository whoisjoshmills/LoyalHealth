Collaboration of some sample work done
This is a small example of some work I have done over Excel, Python, Tableau and SQL.
If there is something specific that you would like me to demonstrate I would be more than willing to look through Kaggle for a dataset that would allow me to showcase my skills.
In both the pandas example and the just Python example they are pulling from the csv file in the resources folder associated with that folder. You should be able to look at the csv by downloading it. I beleive it should read into an excel file.
