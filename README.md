Collaboration of some sample work done.
This is a small example of some work I have done using Excel, VBA and Python to automate some reports. I have some SQL and Tableau Projects I had saved on another computer that I could not recover, so I reached out to the school/certification program to see if they have a copy of the projects since it was all done on an online server.
If there is something specific that you would like me to demonstrate I would be more than willing to look through Kaggle for a dataset that would allow me to showcase my skills.
In both the pandas example and the just Python example they are pulling from the csv file in the resources folder associated with that folder. You should be able to look at the csv by just clicking on it. If that does not work you should be able to download the csv file and display it in an excel folder, this way you can see the extent of the data.
The formatting in school data might display weird but that is due to Git hub importing it a little weird. You can run the code locally on your computer and all the weirdness will disappear. If you are not able to run it I have included some screen shots on how it appears outside of github.
The "Calculating Who Won the Election.ipynb" file that is in the normal Python file automatically displayed the result in the "election_data.txt" file located in the Analysis folder.
In the Vba workbook it should prompt you to enable the macro before it is able to run if there is any trouble runnning it let me know and I will see if I can work around it.
