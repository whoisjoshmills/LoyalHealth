Collaboration of some sample work done
This is a small example of some work I have done over Excel, Python, Tableau and SQL.
If there is something specific that you would like me to demonstrate I would be more than willing to look through Kaggle for a dataset that would allow me to showcase my skills.
In both the pandas example and the just Python example they are pulling from the csv file in the resources folder associated with that folder. You should be able to look at the csv by just clicking on it. If that does not work you should be able to download it and display it in an excel folder.
The formatting in school data might seem a little wonky but that is due to Git hub importing it a little weird. You can run the code locally on your computer if that does not work I can run the code on my local computer and send you guys screen shots.
