Collaboration of some sample work done
This is a small example of some work I have done using Excel, Python, Tableau and SQL.
If there is something specific that you would like me to demonstrate I would be more than willing to look through Kaggle for a dataset that would allow me to showcase my skills.
In both the pandas example and the just Python example they are pulling from the csv file in the resources folder associated with that folder. You should be able to look at the csv by just clicking on it. If that does not work you should be able to download the csv file and display it in an excel folder, this way you can see the extent of the data.
The formatting in school data might seem a little wonky but that is due to Git hub importing it a little weird. You can run the code locally on your computer and all the wonkiness will disappear. If you are not able to run it I have included some screen shots on how it appears outside of github.
